I just finished a game called **Hacknet** and… WOW

It was surprisingly good. Before playing I thought *it's cool but won't it be too boring?* guess what - it wasn't.

Gameplay is kinda repetetive but the music as **EXTREMELY** good.

Story is interesting, the IRC chats often made me laugh.

It was made very smartly, by giving players new executables which makes game progressively more complex - there is not room for boredom.

Even if you are a proggramist, IT guy or tech pro - you should give it a shot.
